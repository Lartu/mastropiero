# ðŸŽ¶ Mastropiero

Mastropiero is a little experimental *compiler* that turns source code into *music*.

## Does it sound good?

No.

## Usage

Clone the repository, install the `pysine` python library (with `pip3` or whatever you use) and run `$ python3 mastropiero.py <your text file>`. Music will not start flowing out of your speakers, but some screeches will. This is Mastropiero's output. You can record it if you want. Mastropiero is fully deterministic, meaning that each file produces the same song everytime it's interpreted.

Multiple note scales are included with the source file, if you want to tweak it just go and comment / uncomment some and see what happens.

## Licence
